<p align="center">Eshojayslay is a pro MUA, actress and Real estate broker from South side of Chicago 42nd cottage grove. Growing up in a neighborhood where the poverty rate was escalating day by day, and going to a school where girls as young as the age of 15 were getting pregnant and dropping out, the odds were against her. “Just because you’re expected to be or do something based on where you come from, doesn’t mean you have to be it.  Your future isn’t written in the stars!” (Eshojayslay). Now she is more than humble and happy with living the life she has now.</p>
<p align="center"> “A celebrity makeup artist, licensed broker for Coldwell (Hyde park office, if anyone needs a house lol) and actress who’s been on multiple shows for NBC, FOX and ShowTime. Never let anyone or anything stand in your way, according to standards of where I’m from I’m supposed to be pregnant with 4 different baby daddy’s. Yet instead I’m a married suburban soccer mom of 2 with 3 different successful careers because I knew in my heart only the sky was my limit.” –Eshojayslay </p>
<p align="center">Although being happy is the only thing that matters when it comes to doing what you love doing, there are also cons, cons such as racism. Eshojayslay is no stranger to racism. Throughout college, fellow students would call her names such as the “N” word and would try to start fights, just so she can get expelled and show the others around them how African Americans are perceived to be. Being the very successful celebrity makeup artist, Eshojayslay was, a woman had booked her to do her makeup for her wedding. That day, when she came in to greet the bride, the bride’s mother saw the color of her skin and immediately shut her down. The bride’s mother no longer wanted her to do her makeup solely based on the color of her skin. Soon after being disrespected, the bride escorted her mother out and apologized to Eshojayslay; she accepted the apology and proceeded with the wedding makeover process.</p>
